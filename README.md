# EyePy

Wrapper around the Python `eye` module for EyeSim (https://roblab.org/eyesim/), fixing bugs, adding proper typing, and adding missing functions present in other EyeSim modules.
Also includes helper functions for common or tedious operations (e.g. stopping all motors, or LCD operations such as converting between world space and screen space).
